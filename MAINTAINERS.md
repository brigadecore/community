# Brigade Maintainers

Maintainer permissions within GitHub are governed by membership in the
__@brigadecore/maintainers__ team, but because the membership of this team is
not publicly visible, this document serves as the public record of individuals
with authority and accountability for _all_ repositories within the
__@brigadecore__ GitHub org.

Individual repositories within the __@brigadecore__ GitHub org may have
_additional_ maintainers, and in such cases, will have their own
`MAINTAINERS.md` linking back to here and listing those additional individuals.
